# Mutual Aid NYC Services List
A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) website for displaying NYC health, human and social services lists in the [Open Referral](https://openreferral.org) data format. Data is managed via [Airtable](https://airtable.com).

## Tecnical Overview
As of our most recent design, the major components and technologies are as follows: 
* Website Front-End
  * Uses Next JS and houses most (if not all) critical logic for fetching and displaying list data from the Intermediate Database. 
* Intermediate Database
  * Uses Postgress SQL and is provisioned by Sync Inc service for Airtable. Read-only(?) and is queried by the Front-End to avoid the Airtable API Query limits. 
* Source Database
  * An existing and continuously updated Airtable. Sync Inc will push updated to Intermediate Database. Any writes should be done manually via Airtable UI atm.
